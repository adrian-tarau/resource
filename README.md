# Resource

_Resource_ aims to provide a simple but powerful low level resource abstraction for Java projects.

It is similar to [Spring Framework Resource](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/core.html#resources) 
or [Apache Commons Virtual File System](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-vfs/).

In addition to basic implementations for file, class path, URL, in-memory and stream resources
resources, the project provides the following implementations:

* sftp: SSH File Transfer Protocol
* s3: Amazon Simple Storage Service
